    <h2>Navigation Bar:</h2>
    <p>The navigation bar will display "Jona Rei". When in mobile, a 3 line icon will appear in the top right of the
        navigation bar to provide links to different points of the webpage.</p>

    <h2>Top half page:</h2>
    <p>The top half of the page will display a slideshow-style gallery of photos of me playing live. Just below this will
        display another archive of YouTube videos that show me playing live gigs to showcase my music and live sound. To the
        right of the video will be a text box showing the title and description of the video.</p>

    <h2>Upcoming Events:</h2>
    <p>This will display as a banner and showcase in a thumbnail-text format all my upcoming events. When in mobile version,
        it will only show one at a time and users can swipe left to see more events posted. It could either be entered
        manually or through a third party event tracker program that will be embedded.</p>

    <h2>Contact Form:</h2>
    <p>This will capture email addresses to help with the creation of a mailing list. The users will be able to enter their
        name, email address, reason for contacting, and their message. When they press send, it will display a window that
        says, "thank you for your contact request, a representative will be in touch with you soon."</p>
    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <p>This will be the last thing to be displayed on the webpage. Text will be displayed in front of a static image. It
        will be to the right of the contact form.</p>

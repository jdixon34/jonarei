    <h1>Persona</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Gavin</p>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 26</p>
    <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Founder of a songwriters collective looking for new talent and bringing the
        community together. They also have a main job they report to and the songwriter's collective is more of a
        passion project. They work odd jobs, and currently they're working at a bar as a bartender.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Macbook user, Monterey OS, safari, and has an iPhone.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Doesn't have much time to waste as he has a family, work, and his
        passion project of bringing the music community together. He doesn't want to waste time on people that are
        not very serious about what they're doing and only wants to find the best to join the collective. The events
        and concerts he organizes are open to the public, but he only wants top talent to attract people and get them
        excited to go to music events around town.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> He has a short temper with people who act like they are serious about
        music, but are only in it for ego, money, or status. He needs to find top talent, and he does not care where.
        He's also frustrated with how unprofessional a lot of talented musicians can be whether it be showing up late
        to an event, not respecting his time, or not having an electronic press kit.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong> His main goal is to birth a lively and competitive music scene that brings the
        community together and produces top-level and professional musicians. He wants to create a new kind of
        nashville, but not the nashville that currently exists. His only concern is: will this musician respect my
        time and others by being professional and humble? He's not looking for braggadocios individuals as those
        people are usually not in it for the music and take they're position for granted whatever it might be.
    </p>
    <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I need to determine whether this musician's electronic press
        kit website reflects well on them as an individual.
